    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      Last updated: <span id="last-updated"></span>
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Perfume Mixer</strong> (the "App"),
      developed by <strong>Scholarship</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"),
      handles your information.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Perfume Mixer, you agree to the collection and use of information
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this
      policy, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>A. Data you create inside the app</h3>
    <p>
      Perfume Mixer allows you to enter and save information related to your
      perfume blends (for example, fragrance notes, ratios, names of blends).
      This data is stored locally on your device and is used only to provide
      the App’s core functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account or provide
      personal details (such as your name, address, or phone number) to use
      the App.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Contact information (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      If you contact us for support or feedback by email, we may receive
      information such as your email address and the contents of your message.
      We use this information solely to respond to you and improve the App.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>
      The current version of Perfume Mixer does not intentionally collect
      analytics data, identifiers, or location data from within the App itself.
      However, your device’s operating system or the app store (for example,
      Google Play) may collect basic diagnostic or usage information in
      accordance with their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We may use the limited information we handle for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the core features of Perfume Mixer.</li>
      <li>To respond to your support requests, questions or feedback.</li>
      <li>To improve App stability, design and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data storage and security</h2>
    <p>
      Your blend data and recipes are stored locally on your device. If you
      uninstall the App, this local data may be removed by the operating system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect any information you share with us
      (for example, through support emails). However, no method of transmission
      over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we
      cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      The current version of Perfume Mixer does not integrate third-party
      services that collect personal information from within the App.
      If future versions add online features (such as cloud backup or
      AI-powered suggestions), this Privacy Policy will be updated to
      clearly describe any additional data processing.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Perfume Mixer is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you
      believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please
      contact us so that we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data sharing and selling</h2>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information.
      We may disclose information only if required to do so by law or in response
      to valid legal requests (for example, court orders or government regulations).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can delete your blend data at any time from within the App (if a
        delete feature is provided) or by uninstalling the App, which typically
        removes local app data from your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose whether or not to contact us by email. If you no longer
        want us to keep previous email communication, you may request deletion
        (see the Contact section below).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. International users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access or use Perfume Mixer from a country outside the developer’s
      country of residence, you understand that information may be processed in
      that country or in other countries where our email or infrastructure
      providers operate. These locations may have data protection laws that
      differ from those in your jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
      revise the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you
      to review this page periodically for any changes.
    </p>
